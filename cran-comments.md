## Previous submission comments

Has fixed this.

Thanks,

Please do not start the description with "This package", package name, title or similar.

Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g. \value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar)
Missing Rd-tags:
     blocksum.Rd: \value

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Victoria Wimmer
